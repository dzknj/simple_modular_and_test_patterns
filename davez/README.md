This is the readme file for my greet program, which is called modname. It says
hello to jersey dave, (myself) on the command line when run and when run with
an argument after the filename modname.js when run with node, it takes that
argument and below the part where it says hello to jersey dave, it says hello
to the argument which should be a name but can be anything. It does this on a
new line.
I have a gulpfile that runs eslint and also the mocha test. It is also set up
so that when you run gulp, it remains open and anytime any of the files are
edited in relation to the tester or the linter, it automatically lints and
tests again. I believe that this is a watch task.
